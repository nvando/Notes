## Main

checking if
``` 
__name__  ==  '__main__'
```
shows whether this file is being run directly by python (```name == main```) 
or is it being imported as a module (```name == file-name```)

if a file is run directly the ```__name__``` variableis set to ```main```  
importing the file as a module sets ```__name__``` to the file name
